Installation from pip should work

setup.py can't rely on osh*.tar.gz. Maybe installosh should generate
the file? INSTALLOSH IS NOW BROKEN

With virtualenv, where do files installed to /usr/... go?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- bug: remoteosh now calls receive_complete following execution (remote
   agg wasn't working)

- Simplify reduction over column: Don't require agg
  initialization. Would return None instead of initial value in case
  of no initialization.

  - API
  - user guide


- Should the agg values be nested?

osh gen 10 1 ^ agg -r '(0, 1)' 'sum, prod, x: (sum + x, prod * x)' $
((1, 1), 1)
((3, 2), 2)
((6, 6), 3)
((10, 24), 4)
((15, 120), 5)
((21, 720), 6)
((28, 5040), 7)
((36, 40320), 8)
((45, 362880), 9)
((55, 3628800), 10)

1.0

Check sql connection close, postgres and dbapi

check schema access via postgres, dbapi

docs:

- crossrefs

- Make the docs less plain - color, css for headers.

......................................................................

sql

- remote passes thread state pickled, along with the pipeline.

- remoteosh sets thread state.

- sql looks for schema in thread state.

- sql setup looks for set_schema config, and runs this statement to
  set the schema, (for both dbtype and driver configs).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sql command: Add schema capability to sql command. (Then asql2 isn't
needed. Make schema part of threadid). Not clear how this works in
general (dbapi driver).

osh gen <function> should do the same thing as osh f <function> ^
expand. Problem for cli, distinguishing function from number.

squish '+ min max' should be squish + min max

Get rid of class level declarations.

expand: File expansion for files only, not strings

----------------------------------------------------------------------

split stream (inverse of merge)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

review uniq args -- anything to steal?
       -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences
       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines
       -u, --unique
              only print unique lines

unique: Instead of sorting, emit immediately, and then use hash table
to remember what has been output. (Doesn't work with -c, -u)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

help.py calls __import__. Should use loader to make use of osh search path.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

expand -1 should work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

installation:

- install, installosh: Multi-column output if it doesn't fit in one.

- error reporting is often unreadable. Multiline output problem?

- Auto install

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Map support

- conversion between list of (key, value) and map.
