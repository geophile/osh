<h1>Introduction</h1>

Osh (Object SHell) is a tool that integrates the processing of
operating system objects,
Python objects, database access, and remote access to a cluster of
nodes. These capabilities are made available through a command-line
interface (CLI) and a Python application programming interface (API).

<h2>Execution Model</h2>

Osh processes streams of Python objects using simple commands. Complex
data processing is achieved by command sequences in which the output
from one command is passed to the input of the next. This is similar
to composing Unix commands using pipes.  However, Unix commands pass
strings from one command to the next, and the commands (grep, awk,
sed, etc.) are heavily string-oriented.  Osh commands process Python
objects, and it is objects that are sent from one command to the
next. Objects may be primitive types such as strings and numbers;
composite types such as tuples, lists and maps; objects representing
files, processes, dates and times; or user-defined objects.

<p>
The first command in an osh command sequence generates a stream of
objects. Each subsequent command reads a stream of objects and writes
a stream of objects. For a given command, the relationship between
inputs and outputs is not necessarily one-to-one. For example,
the <tt>f</tt> command reads one object from the stream, applies a
function to it, and then generates one object to its output
stream. But the <tt>select</tt> command copies objects from the input
stream to the output stream if and only if the <tt>select</tt>'s
predicate evaluates to true for the input object. <tt>expand</tt> may
generate any number of output objects for a single input object.

<p>
Commands, in addition to operating on input and output streams, may
have side-effects.  For example, <tt>out</tt> writes to stdout or a
file; <tt>sql</tt> may update a database; and commands with function
arguments (e.g. <tt>f</tt>, <tt>select</tt>) can operate on variables
in the osh command sequence's namespace.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<b>List the files in the current directory:</b> 

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh ls ^ out
    ('./history.html',)
    ('./index.html',)
    ('./license.txt',)
    ('./ref',)
    ('./similar.html',)
    ('./userguide',)
</pre>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>osh:</tt></b> Invokes the osh interpreter.
  <li><b><tt>ls:</tt></b> This is an osh command, not a shell command. Like the shell's <tt>ls</tt> command,
    the osh <tt>ls</tt> command lists the files in the current directory. But instead of producing 
    filenames printed to stdout, <tt>osh.File</tt> objects are produced and
    sent to the command's output stream.
  <li><b><tt>^:</tt></b> This is the osh symbol for piping objects from one command to the next. The <tt>osh.File</tt>
    objects produced by the previous command (<tt>ls</tt>) are piped to the next command (<tt>out</tt>).
  <li><b><tt>out:</tt></b> This command takes a stream of objects as input, renders each as a string using
    the python function <tt>str</tt>, and prints the string on stdout. 
</ul>

The reason that the output contains tuples such as <tt>('./index.html',)</tt> instead of strings
is that osh always pipes tuples between commands. The input to <tt>out</tt> is a stream of tuples, which are
rendered using <tt>str</tt>. Standard python formatting can be used by supplying a formatting argument to
<tt>out</tt>. So to render as an unquoted string,
the command line would be
<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh ls ^ out %s
</pre>

<tt>osh.File</tt> objects have a number of attributes. These can be examined and printed, e.g.

<p><b>List files and selected attributes:</b>

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh ls ^ f 'lambda file: (oct(file.mode), file.size, file)' $
    ('0100644', 8137, './history.html')
    ('0100644', 5508, './index.html')
    ('0100644', 733, './license.txt')
    ('040755', 10234, './ref')
    ('0100644', 2108, './similar.html')
    ('040755', 408, './userguide')
</pre>

In this command sequence, the output from the <tt>ls</tt> command, a stream of <tt>osh.File</tt> objects,
is piped to the <tt>f</tt> command. <tt>f</tt> applies a function to each input tuple, and sends
the resulting value to the output stream. In this example, the function has one argument named <tt>file</tt>.
Output from this command contains the file's mode (in octal), size, and
the file itself.

<p>This example also shows that <tt>^ out</tt> may be replaced by the symbol <tt>$</tt>. (If you need to
specify a formatting argument or other argument to <tt>out</tt>, then this shorthand cannot be used.)


<p><b>Filter out directories:</b>
  
<p>To limit the information printed to just files, omitting directories, the output from <tt>ls</tt> can be filtered:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh ls ^ select 'file: file.isfile' ^ f 'file: (oct(file.mode), file.size, file)' $
    ('0100644', 8137, './history.html')
    ('0100644', 5508, './index.html')
    ('0100644', 733, './license.txt')
    ('0100644', 2108, './similar.html')
</pre>

Now, the output from <tt>ls</tt> is piped to <tt>select</tt>. <tt>select</tt> has a function
argument which selects <tt>osh.File</tt>s for which the <tt>isfile</tt> attribute is true. The selected
<tt>osh.File</tt>s are then passed on and processed as before.

<p>In this command sequence, the commands <tt>f</tt> and <tt>select</tt> both have function arguments, but
the python keyword <tt>lambda</tt> keyword has been omitted, a shorthand permitted by osh.

<p><b>Recursive listing:</b>

<p>A recursive listing can be obtained by using the <tt>-r</tt> flag to the <tt>ls</tt> command:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh ls -r ^ f 'file: (oct(file.mode), file.size, file)' $
    ('040755', 10234, './ref')
    ('040755', 408, './userguide')
    ('0100644', 8137, './history.html')
    ('0100644', 5508, './index.html')
    ('0100644', 733, './license.txt')
    ('0100644', 2108, './similar.html')
    ('0100644', 50938, './ref/api-objects.txt')
    ('0100644', 15841, './ref/class-tree.html')
    ...
    ('0100644', 8302, './userguide/config.html')
    ('0100644', 503, './userguide/index.html')
    ('0100644', 4201, './userguide/installation.html')
    ('0100644', 8888, './userguide/intro.html')
</pre>

<p><b>Listing from all nodes of a cluster:</b>

Osh commands can be run remotely, on multiple hosts, in parallel. For example, suppose you
have a cluster named <tt>fred</tt>, with hosts <tt>101</tt>, <tt>102</tt>, and <tt>103</tt>,
(the cluster name and node names would be specified in the
osh configuration file, <tt>.oshrc</tt>). You could list the
<tt>/var/log/messages*</tt> files from all these nodes as follows:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh @fred [ ls '/var/log/messages*' ^ f 'file: (oct(file.mode), file.size, file.abspath)' ] $
    ('101', '0100600', 153311, '/var/log/messages.3')
    ('101', '0100600', 245349, '/var/log/messages.4')
    ('101', '0100600', 238494, '/var/log/messages')
    ('101', '0100600', 75552, '/var/log/messages.1')
    ('101', '0100600', 99174, '/var/log/messages.2')
    ('102', '0100600', 153311, '/var/log/messages.3')
    ('102', '0100600', 245349, '/var/log/messages.4')
    ('102', '0100600', 238494, '/var/log/messages')
    ('102', '0100600', 75552, '/var/log/messages.1')
    ('103', '0100600', 160875, '/var/log/messages.2')
    ('103', '0100600', 419873, '/var/log/messages.3')
    ('103', '0100600', 66614, '/var/log/messages.4')
    ('103', '0100600', 57772, '/var/log/messages')
    ('103', '0100600', 87651, '/var/log/messages.1')
    ('103', '0100600', 99989, '/var/log/messages.2')
</pre>

<tt>@fred [ ... ]</tt> specifies that the bracketed command
will be executed remotely, on each node of cluster <tt>fred</tt>,
in parallel. Note that the last returned value is specified as <tt>file.abspath</tt>, the file's absolute path --
a string, and not <tt>file</tt>, the <tt>osh.File</tt> object itself. The reason for this is that <tt>osh.File</tt>
objects cannot transmitted, (from a host in the <tt>fred</tt> cluster to the local host).
Attributes of an <tt>osh.File</tt> object are computed on demand, and
so cannot be obtained outside of the host containing the file. <tt>Process</tt> objects
have similar restrictions.

<p><b>Sum of file sizes across the cluster:</b>

<p>Suppose that we want to compute the sum
of the sizes of all the /var/log/messages* files in all the nodes of the <tt>fred</tt>
cluster. The aggregation command, <tt>agg</tt> can be used to do this:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">jao@zack$</font> osh @fred [ ls '/var/log/messages*' ^ f 'file: file.size' ] ^ agg 0 'sum, node, size: sum + size' $
    (2417360,)
</pre>

The remote <tt>ls</tt> has been simplified since all we want to do is sum the sizes; we don't
need the other attributes returned in the previous examples.

<p>The first argument to <tt>agg</tt> is the initial value of the accumulator, <tt>0</tt>. The second
argument is an aggregation function. The first argument of this function is the
current value of the accumulator, <tt>sum</tt>, and the remaining arguments are the
values returned from the nodes of the cluster. The function returns <tt>sum + size</tt>
as its value, which is then bound to <tt>sum</tt> for the next tuple of input
from the cluster.


<h2>Osh Interfaces</h2>

Osh has two interfaces:

<p>
<b><a href="cli.html">Command-line interface (CLI)</a>:</b> The osh executable interprets command-line arguments as osh syntax.
    Any shell should be usable, however some osh CLI syntax may require escapes in some shells. (The osh
    CLI has been tested most extensively using the bash shell.)

<p>
<b><a href="api.html">Python application programming interface (API)</a>:</b> The osh CLI invokes the osh runtime,
    which invokes Python modules corresponding to each command. The runtime and command modules
    can also be invoked from a Python API.
