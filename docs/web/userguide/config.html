<h1>Configuring osh</h1>

If osh is used to access databases or clusters, then connection information is required. This information
is kept in a configuration file. The configuration file can also be used to define variable and function
definitions for use in osh commands.

<h2>Location of the osh configuration file</h2>

The osh interpreter searches for an osh configuration file, checking
these locations, in this order:

<ul>
  <li><tt><b>./.oshrc</b></tt>
  <li><tt><b>~/.oshrc</b></tt>
  <li><tt><b>/etc/oshrc</b></tt>
</ul>

If none of these files exist, then osh will not be able to access any database or cluster.
<p>
If the osh configuration file is going to be used for database access, then it may contain
a plaintext database password. It is therefore good practice to restrict access this file to,
e.g. set permissions to <tt>600</tt>.

<h2>Structure of the configuration file</h2>

The <tt>.oshrc</tt> file contains Python code. The API for specifying a configuration
is contained in the module <tt>osh.config</tt>, so <tt>.oshrc</tt> always begins with this
line:

<pre>
    from osh.config import *
</pre>

Database and cluster configuration is done using field and slice notation. For example,
to specify that the <tt>sql</tt> command connects to
the <tt>family</tt> database as 'jao':

<pre>
    osh.sql.family.database = 'family'
    osh.sql.family.user = 'jao'
</pre>

<ul>
<li><tt>osh</tt> is the base configuration object.
<li><tt>osh.sql</tt> indicates that database connection for the <tt>sql</tt> command is being configured.
<li><tt>osh.sql.family</tt> means that a database with logical name <tt>family</tt> is being configured.
<li><tt>osh.sql.family.database = 'family'</tt> means that the actual name of the database, (understood by the database system), is <tt>familydb</tt>.
<li><tt>osh.sql.family.user = 'jao'</tt> means that the connection to <tt>familydb</tt> is done as user <tt>jao</tt>.
</ul>


<p>
Slice notation is also supported, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.sql['family'].user = 'jao'
</pre>

This is useful in case a database or cluster name is known dynamically, or is not
a legal Python identifier.

<h2>Configuring database access</h2>

Database access is done using the <tt>sql</tt> command, e.g.

<pre>
    osh sql family 'select count(*) from request' $
</pre>

<tt>family</tt> is the name of a database profile, specified in <tt>.oshrc</tt>.
The profile specifies a module implementing the connect method of a DBAPI 2.0 driver, and
the arguments to the module's <tt>connect</tt> method, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.sql.family.driver = 'psycopg2'
    osh.sql.family.host = 'localhost'
    osh.sql.family.database = 'familydb'
    osh.sql.family.user = 'jao'
    osh.sql.family.password = 'l3tme1n'
</pre>

This specification results in a connection to a postgres database, through the psycopg2 driver,
being created as <tt>psycopg2.connect(host = 'localhost', database =
'familydb', user = 'jao', password = 'l3tme1n')</tt>.

<p>The DBAPI driver is not included with osh. It needs to be in your python environment,
located on PYTHONPATH, in site-packages, or in a location specified by sitecustomize.py.

A default database profile can be specified by assigning a value to <tt>osh.sql</tt>, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.sql = 'family'
</pre>

If this is done, then the <tt>sql</tt> command can omit the database profile name, e.g.

<pre>
    osh sql 'select count(*) from request' $
</pre>

<h2>Cluster configuration</h2>

This command executes a query on each node of cluster <tt>fred</tt>:

<pre>
    osh @fred [ sql family 'select name, age from person' ] $
</pre>

Each node of fred's cluster must 
configure a database profile named <tt>family</tt> in its
<tt>.oshrc</tt> file.
<p>
On the local node (the one on which the above command is entered), the
cluster <tt>fred</tt> must be configured, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.remote.fred.hosts = ['192.168.100.101',
                             '192.168.100.102',
                             '192.168.100.103']
</pre>

Access to the cluster is done as <tt>root</tt>. If you want to connect as
some other user, specify the user as follows:

<pre>
    osh.remote.fred.user = 'zack'
</pre>

Remote access is done using ssh, and osh cannot handle any prompts, e.g. for password
or a passphrase. If you can connect to a host silently using ssh, e.g. by setting
up an ssh agent, then that will work for osh. If you use the <tt>ssh -i</tt> option,
then the identity can be specified in <tt>.oshrc</tt>, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.remote.fred.identity = '~/.ssh/fred.pem'
</pre>

(You can check your ssh connection using
the <tt>testssh</tt> command, e.g. <tt>osh @fred [ testssh ] $</tt>.)

<p>When a remote command is run on a cluster, each row of output identifies the
node that generated the output, e.g.

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql family 'select name, age from person' ] $
    ('192.168.100.101', 'hannah', 15)
    ('192.168.100.101', 'julia', 10)
    ('192.168.100.102', 'alexander', 16)
    ('192.168.100.102', 'nathan', 15)
    ('192.168.100.102', 'zoe', 11)
    ('192.168.100.103', 'danica', 1)
</pre>

The <tt>hosts</tt> part of a cluster specification can also be done using a <tt>dict</tt>, in which
the key is a name for the node, and the value is the IP address, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.remote.fred.hosts = {'101': '192.168.100.101',
                             '102': '192.168.100.102',
                             '103': '192.168.100.103'}
</pre>

The node names are used in command output in place of IP addresses, e.g.

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql familydb 'select name, age from person' ] $
    ('101', 'hannah', 15)
    ('101', 'julia', 10)
    ('102', 'alexander', 16)
    ('102', 'nathan', 15)
    ('102', 'zoe', 11)
    ('103', 'danica', 1)
</pre>

These examples assume that each node of cluster <tt>fred</tt> has
a <tt>.oshrc</tt> file that configures a database profile
named <tt>family</tt>. It is also possible to configure database
access even when each node specifies a different database profile, e.g.

<pre>
    osh.remote.fred.hosts = {'101': {'host': '192.168.100.101', 'db_profile': 'db1'},
                             '102': {'host': '192.168.100.102', 'db_profile': 'db2'},
                             '103': {'host': '192.168.100.103', 'db_profile': 'db3'}}
</pre>

With this configuration <tt>osh @fred [ sql 'select ...' ] ...</tt>
accesses <tt>db1</tt> on node <tt>101</tt>, <tt>db2</tt> on node <tt>102</tt>, and <tt>db3</tt> on
node <tt>103</tt>.

<p>
The complete rules for selecting a database profile are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Local execution (e.g. <tt><b>osh sql ...</b></tt>):
<ul>
<li>If profile is specified with sql command, use it.
<li>If no profile is specified, use the default profile in <tt>.oshrc</tt>.
</ul>
<li>Remote execution (e.g. <tt><b>osh @cluster [ sql ... ]</b></tt>):
<ul>
<li>If profile is specified with <tt>sql</tt> command, use it, looking up the profile name in <tt>.oshrc</tt> on each node of the cluster.
<li>If no profile is specified with the <tt>sql</tt> command, and the remote host has a <tt>db_profile</tt> specified (in the cluster's configuration in the local <tt>.oshrc</tt>), use that profile as configured in the <tt>.oshrc</tt> file on the remote host.
<li>If no profile is specified with the <tt>sql</tt> command, and the remote host has no <tt>db_profile</tt> specified, then use the default database profile from <tt>.oshrc</tt> on the remote host.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Arbitrary Python code in <tt>.oshrc</tt></h2>

<tt>.oshrc</tt> contains Python code, and any symbols defined in it are available to osh commands.
For example, this code prints the squares and cubes of the first ten integers:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ f 'x: (x**2, x**3)' $
</pre>

The same computation can be done by writing a function to compute squares and cubes:

<pre>
    def square_and_cube(x):
        return x**2, x**3
</pre>

and putting this function definition in <tt>.oshrc</tt>. Then, the osh
command above can be rewritten as:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ f 'x: square_and_cube(x)' $
</pre>

<h2>Locating user-defined osh commands</h2>

It is easy to write your own osh commands (although the procedure is
currently not documented).  In order for such commands to be located
by the osh interpreter, a search path needs to be specified
in <tt>.oshrc</tt>. For example, suppose you have written a
command <tt>xyz</tt> and placed its implementation, <tt>xyz.py</tt>,
in <tt>/usr/local/foobar</tt>. Then you must add this to <tt>.oshrc</tt>:

<pre>
    osh.path = ['/usr/local/foobar']
</pre>

or the osh interpreter will not find xyz when used in an osh command sequence.

<p>The value of <tt>osh.path</tt> is a list so that custom commands can be placed in
any number of directories.
