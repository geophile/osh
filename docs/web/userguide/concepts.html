<h1>Osh Concepts</h1>

This section discusses the major concepts embodied in osh. While these
concepts apply to both the command-line and application programming
interfaces, examples are mostly given in CLI notation.

<h2>Commands and Streams</h2>

An osh <i>command sequence</i> consists of a sequence of osh commands,
connected by streams. An osh <i>stream</i> carries tuples from one
command in a sequence to the next. Each osh <i>command</i> reads a
stream of zero or more tuples, writes a stream of zero or more tuples,
and may have side-effects. The input stream of the first command of a
command sequence always has zero tuples.

<p>
  Sometimes, there is a one-to-one correspondence between tuples in
  a command's input stream and its output stream. For example,
  the <tt>f</tt> command applies a function to each input tuple to
  yield a value written to the output stream. In other cases, a single
  input tuple may give rise to multiple output tuples or to none at
  all. Some commands collect inputs, possibly even all inputs, and
  then emit output later. For example, the <tt>sort</tt>
  and <tt>unique</tt> commands accumulate all input before generating
  sorted output, or output with duplicates removed.
  
<p>
  It is a good idea to be aware of how many input tuples a command
  must accumulate, and avoid situations in which memory requirements
  may be very high or unbounded. For example, suppose you need to scan
  some log files, filtering based on a pattern, and sorting matching
  lines by time. If you sort and then filter, memory requirements
  would be equal to the volume of all the log files. If you filter
  first, then you can greatly reduce memory requirements because
  filtering (done by the <tt>select</tt> command) examines each input,
  sends it to output or not, and then forgets about it. The amount of
  data that the <tt>sort</tt> command has to deal with is reduced to
  the lines that get through the filter.

<h2>Functions</h2>

A number of osh commands have function arguments. For example,
the <tt>select</tt> command applies its function to each input tuple,
passing it on to the output stream if and only if the function
evaluates to true. Example (using the CLI):

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ select 'lambda x: (x % 2) == 0' ^ out
    (0,)
    (2,)
    (4,)
    (6,)
    (8,)
</pre>

<tt>gen 10</tt> generates the first ten integers, <tt>0, 1, ...,
9</tt>.  Each integer is passed to the next command, <tt>select</tt>,
which applies the function <tt>(x % 2) == 0</tt>, where x is the
argument to the function. This evalutes to true only for even
numbers. <tt>out</tt> prints its input to stdout.

<p>The function argument to <tt>select</tt> is a Python lambda
  expression. When a function is specified in this way -- inside a
  string literal -- osh permits the keyword <tt>lambda</tt> to be
  omitted, so <tt>... ^ select 'x: (x % 2) == 0' ^ ...</tt> is
  also correct.

<p>The osh API also supports both functions contained in strings, as
  above, and Python expressions evaluating to functions, such as
  function names and lambda expressions, (i.e. real lambda expressions,
  not contained in strings). So the example above could be expressed
  in the API as follows:

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    from osh.api import *

    osh(gen(10), select(lambda x: (x % 2) == 0), out())
</pre>

or

<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/python
    
    from osh.api import *
    
    def even(x):
        return x % 2 == 0
    
    osh(gen(10), select(even), out())
</pre>

There is one situation in which a function argument must be expressed
as a string: if the function is going to be executed remotely. The
reason for this restriction is that remote execution is done by
pickling command sequences, and objects of type function cannot always
be pickled.

<p>Osh always pipes tuples between commands.
If a command writes a single object to a stream, (e.g. the <tt>gen</tt>
command), then the osh interpreter wraps the object into a 1-tuple. If a command writes a list,
then the list is not wrapped, but is converted to a tuple of the same size.
So to be more precise, in the example above,
osh actually pipes the tuples
<tt>(0,), (1,), ..., (9,)</tt> from <tt>gen</tt> to <tt>select</tt>.
The stream coming out of the <tt>select</tt> command comprises the
tuples <tt>(0,), (2,), (4,), (6,), (8,)</tt>.

<p>If a stream of tuples is passed to a command that has a function
argument, then the tuple elements are bound to function arguments in
the usual pythonic way. Example:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ f 'x: (x, x**2)' ^ f 'x, x_squared: (x, x + x_squared)' ^ out
    (0, 0)
    (1, 2)
    (2, 6)
    (3, 12)
    (4, 20)
    (5, 30)
    (6, 42)
    (7, 56)
    (8, 72)
    (9, 90)
</pre>

<tt>(0,), (1,), ..., (9,)</tt> are piped to the first <tt>f</tt>
command, which generates tuples <tt>(x, x**2)</tt> for each input <tt>x</tt>.
So the output stream from this command contains 2-tuples:
<tt>(0, 0), (1, 1), ..., (9, 81)</tt>. The elements in each tuple are then bound
to the arguments of the second <tt>f</tt> command, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>x_squared</tt>.
So for the <tt>(9, 81)</tt> tuple, <tt>x = 9</tt> and <tt>x_squared = 81</tt>.

<p>
Arbitrary-length argument lists work as usual. For example,
suppose you have a file containing CSV (comma-separated values) data,
in which each row contains 20 items. If you want to add integers in columns 7 and
18 (0-based) then you could
invoke <tt>f</tt>, providing a function with 20 arguments, and add the 7th and
18th items. Or you could use an argument list:

<pre>
    cat data.csv | osh ^ f 's: s.split(",")' ^ f '*row: int(row[7]) + int(row[18])' ^ out
</pre>

<tt>cat data.csv</tt> is a host OS command which copies the contents
of data.csv to stdout. This is piped (by a host OS pipe), to
osh.
<tt>osh ^</tt> converts stdin to a stream of 1-tuples, each containing
one line of input (with the terminal <tt>\n</tt> removed).
Each such line contains values separated by commas;
<tt>f 's: s.split(",")'</tt> splits each such line into a tuple of values.
The next command, <tt>f: '*row: int(row[7]) + int(row[18])'</tt>, assigns the entire tuple
to <tt>row</tt> instead of assigning each tuple value to one function argument.

<h2>Error and Exception Handling</h2>

An <i>exception handler</i> handles exceptions thrown by osh commands.
An <i>error handler</i> handles stderr content.
For example, division by zero raises the <tt>ZeroDivisionError</tt> exception. The default
exception handler prints a description of the problem to stderr. Example:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh gen 3 ^ f 'x: x / (x-1)' $
    (0,)
    f#3[x: x / (x-1)](1):  exceptions.ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
    (2,)
</pre>

<tt>gen 3</tt> generates the integers 0, 1, 2. These integers are piped to the function
<tt>x: x / (x-1)</tt> which raises <tt>ZeroDivisionError</tt> for <tt>x</tt> = 1. The first and
third lines of output show the expected output for <tt>x</tt> = 0 and 2, printed to stdout.
The middle line goes to stderr:

<ul>

  <li><tt>f#3</tt> identifies the command that failed (<tt>f</tt>) and
  an identifier, unique within the command's parse tree. (The parse tree can be
  seen by running osh with the -v flag.)

  <li>The brackets following the command, <tt>[x: x / (x-1)]</tt>,
  identify the command's arguments.

  <li><tt>(1)</tt> shows the input that caused the function to raise an exception.

  <li>The exception's class and message are included.

</ul>

<p>
A similar mechanism is used in case an osh command writes to
stderr. Each line going to stderr is passed to the error handler.
The default error handler adds context information and writes to osh's
stderr. 

<p>
The default exception and error handlers can be overridden. This can
be done by invoking <tt>set_exception_handler</tt> and <tt>set_error_handler</tt>
from <tt>.oshrc</tt>. (See the documentation on the
module <tt>osh.error</tt>
for details.)

<h2>Files</h2>

Osh represents files by objects of type <tt>osh.File</tt>, which are created by the
<tt>ls</tt> command. For example, this command sequence lists the contents of the
current directory, providing the mode (in octal) and size of each file:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh ls ^ f 'file: (file, oct(file.mode), file.size)' $
    ('./api.html', '0100644', 8252)
    ('./cli.html', '0100644', 13338)
    ('./concepts.html', '0100644', 11242)
    ('./config.html', '0100644', 8306)
    ('./index.html', '0100644', 506)
    ('./installation.html', '0100644', 4204)
    ('./intro.html', '0100644', 10103)
</pre>

<h2>Processes</h2>

Osh represents processes by objects of type <tt>osh.Process</tt>, which are created
by the <tt>ps</tt> command. For example, this command sequence lists
python processes, providing the pid and command line of each:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh ps ^ select 'p: "python" in p.command_line' ^ f 'p: (p.pid, p.command_line)' $
    (2285, '/usr/bin/python /usr/sbin/yum-updatesd ')
    (2575, '/usr/bin/python -tt /usr/bin/puplet ')
    (2648, '/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/osh ps ^ select p: "python" in p.command_line ^ f p: (p.pid, p.command_line) $ ')
</pre>


<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>A number of osh commands require configuration information. For example, osh has the
  concept of a <i>cluster</i>. A cluster has a logical name, and a set of nodes.
  Each node has a logical name and an address, and access to the nodes is carried out
  as some user, (typically root). All this information is specified in the osh
  configuration file, typically <tt>~/.oshrc</tt>.

<p>Database access also requires configuration. Each database has a logical name, for
  use in the osh <tt>sql</tt> command. Database configuration identifies a database driver and
  specifies connection information.

<p>Configuration information is specified as python code. For example, here is a typical
  configuration file:

<pre>
    from osh.config import *
    
    osh.sql = 'family'
    osh.sql.family.driver = 'pg8000.dbapi'
    osh.sql.family.host = 'localhost'
    osh.sql.family.database = 'mydb'
    osh.sql.family.user = 'jao'
    osh.sql.family.password = 'jao'
    
    osh.remote.fred.hosts = {
        '101': '192.168.100.101',
        '102': '192.168.100.102',
        '103': '192.168.100.103'
    }

    def factorial(x):
        if x == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return x * factorial(x - 1)
</pre>

The configuration file must start by including the symbols defined in osh.config.

<p>The <tt>family</tt> database is configured as follows:
<ul>
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql = 'family'</tt></b> Specifies that <tt>family</tt> is the
      default database for the osh <tt>sql</tt> command.
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql.family.driver = 'pg8000.dbapi'</tt></b> The driver module
      containing the <tt>connect</tt> function. This module must be reachable in
      your python environment, (e.g. via PYTHONPATH, site-packages, or sitecustomize.py).
      <tt>osh.sql.family</tt> specifies that we are configuring access to the
      database whose logical name is <tt>family</tt>
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql.family.host = 'localhost'</tt></b> <tt>pg8000.dbapi.connect</tt>
      has a host argument; this specifies its value.
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql.family.database = 'mydb'</tt></b> The <tt>database</tt> argument
      to <tt>connect</tt>.
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql.family.user = 'jao'</tt></b> The <tt>user</tt> argument to <tt>connect</tt>.
    <li><b><tt>osh.sql.family.password = 'jao'</tt></b> The <tt>password</tt> argument to <tt>connect</tt>.
</ul>

<p>Note that the exact properties specified for database configuration will vary depending
  on the driver.

<p>The osh configuration also specifies a cluster named <tt>fred</tt> with three nodes. The value
  of the <tt>osh.remote.fred.hosts</tt> specifies the logical name and address of each cluster node.

<p>The osh configuration file is just python code.
  In the example above, the <tt>factorial</tt> function is defined.
  Any symbols defined are available for use
  in osh command sequences, e.g.

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ f 'x: (x, factorial(x))' $
    (0, 1)
    (1, 1)
    (2, 2)
    (3, 6)
    (4, 24)
    (5, 120)
    (6, 720)
    (7, 5040)
    (8, 40320)
    (9, 362880)
</pre>  

<h2>Database Access</h2>

The osh <tt>sql</tt> command provides access to relational databases. The connection to the database
is described in the osh configuration file. Any DBAPI-compliant driver should work with osh.

<p>For a <tt>select</tt> statement, each row of the result gives rise to one tuple. For example, if
  your database has a <tt>person</tt> table, with columns <tt>name</tt> (varchar) and <tt>age</tt>
  (int), then it can be
  queried like this:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh sql 'select * from person' $
    ('hannah', 15)
    ('julia', 10)
    ('alexander', 16)
    ('nathan', 15)
    ('zoe', 11)
    ('danica', 1)
</pre>

Note that the tuples have string and int components, matching the types declared in
the database.

<p>For other kinds of statements, output from the SQL command depends on the driver.
  SQL queries can also have inputs, indicated by python string formatting notation. For
  example, suppose you have a file containing input to the person table, e.g. 'hannah 15'.
  The following osh command sequence reads the file, splits out the fields, and binds them
  to the SQL statement:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> cat persons.txt | osh ^ \
          f 's: s.split()' ^ f 'name, age: (name, int(age))' ^ sql 'insert into person values(%s, %s)'
</pre>

<tt>cat persons.txt | osh</tt> pipes each line of input to osh (using OS pipes). <tt>osh ^</tt>
converts stdin into an osh stream whose tuples each contain one string. The first <tt>f</tt>
command splits the line into two fields, and the second <tt>f</tt> command converts the
second field (age) to an int. The tuples piped to the <tt>sql</tt> command then have names
and ages, correctly typed as string and int respectively.

<h2>Remote and Parallel Execution</h2>

<p>An osh command sequence normally executes in a single thread. Multiple thread of execution
  may be introduced by using the <tt>fork</tt> command. <tt>fork</tt> has two arguments: a
  thread generator, and a sequence of commands to be executed on each thread. The thread generator is
  used to create a number of threads, and to generate a unique <i>label</i> for each thread.

<p>The thread generator can be any of the following:
  <ul>
    <li><b>A positive integer:</b> If the thread generator is <i>n</i>, then <i>n</i>
      threads will be created. The thread labels are 0, 1, ..., <i>n</i> - 1.
    <li><b>A sequence:</b> A thread is created for and labelled with each item in the sequence.
    <li><b>A cluster name:</b> A thread is created for each node in the named cluster.
      The thread label is the name of the node. (Cluster nodes and node names are
      specified in the osh configuration file, .oshrc.) The thread does not execute the
      command locally, as in the cases above, but on the node corresponding to the thread's label.
    <li><b>A function:</b> The function is evaluated and is expected to evaluate to a positive integer,
      sequence, or cluster name. Execution then proceeds as in the above three cases.
  </ul>

<p><b>Parallel execution example:</b>

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> time osh @5 [ sh 'sleep 3; echo hello' ] $
    (0, 'hello')
    (1, 'hello')
    (2, 'hello')
    (3, 'hello')
    (4, 'hello')
    
    real	0m3.164s
    user	0m0.090s
    sys	0m0.106s
</pre>

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>osh @5 [ ... ]</tt></b> generates 5 threads, with labels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and executes
    the bracketed command on each.
  <li><b><tt>time ...</tt></b> is the standard Unix time command.
  <li><b><tt>sh</tt></b> is an osh command for escaping to the shell. 
  <li><b><tt>sleep 3; echo hello</tt></b> <tt>sh</tt> is used to execute this sequence of
    command in the host OS -- sleep for 3 seconds and then print <tt>hello</tt>.
</ul>

<p>Each line of output contains a thread id and output from the executed command. E.g. <tt>(2, 'hello')</tt>
  is the output produced by the thread with label 2. Following output from the osh command is output
  from <tt>time</tt>. This part of the output shows that the five threads executed in parallel. Each
  thread slept for 3 seconds, and the total running time of the entire osh command is just over 3 seconds.

<p><b>Remote execution example:</b>

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sh '/sbin/ifconfig | grep 192 ] $
    ('101', '          inet addr:192.168.100.101  Bcast:192.168.100.255  Mask:255.255.255.0')
    ('102', '          inet addr:192.168.100.102  Bcast:192.168.100.255  Mask:255.255.255.0')
    ('103', '          inet addr:192.168.100.103  Bcast:192.168.100.255  Mask:255.255.255.0')
</pre>

The cluster <tt>fred</tt> has been configured with three nodes, at IP addresses
192.168.100.101-103. Each node's name is the last octet of its address. The above command
runs remotely the OS command <tt>/sbin/ifconfig | grep 192</tt>, (reporting
the IP address of the node executing the command). The output demonstrates
that the command was run on each node of the specified cluster.

<h2>Aggregating Partial Results from Cluster Nodes</h2>

<p>When working with a cluster, it is often useful to retrieve or compute
data from each node and then combine the results. The simplest way of
doing this is to use osh's remote execution capabilities, which lists
the results from each node in no particular order, (results from
different nodes may be interleaved). For example, suppose that each
node of cluster <tt>fred</tt> has a database containing a table listing
information on files.
The table is named <tt>file</tt> and has three columns:

<ul>
  <li><b>path:</b> File location.
  <li><b>hash:</b> MD5 hash of file content.
  <li><b>size:</b> Size of file in bytes.
</ul>

A listing of all files can be done as follows:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql 'select path, hash, size from file' ] $
    ('101', '/2007/jan/15/img0419.jpg', '89d95cc3a3933f9107070d6114427758', 4605997)
    ('103', '/documents/marketing/xyz3000_white_paper.doc, '7ab31e12597926be67d5adecd463d028', 601887)
    ('103', '/documents/marketing/xyz3000_specs.doc, '25e14bb586b62f66bd350a6b09e5ca0f', 78901)
    ('102', '/documents/legal/nda.pdf', 'd0f05c5b57d152584cea9b8e8884b277', 889128)
    ...
</pre>

<p>The first element of each tuple identifies the node that provided the tuple.

<p>Another approach to combining results is to compute summary information, e.g. counting
the files on all nodes and computing their total size. This can be done on each node in sql,
e.g. <tt>select count(*), sum(size) from file</tt>. The osh aggregation command can be used
to combine the results from these queries:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql 'select count(*), sum(size) from file' ] ^ \
          agg '(0, 0)' \
              'total_count, total_size, node, node_count, node_size: total_count + node_count, total_size + node_size' $
    (9415687, 11624297350072)
</pre>

<p><tt>agg</tt> is the aggregation command. <tt>(0, 0)</tt> is the
initial value of the accumulator; the first element will accumulate
the count, and the second element is for the total size.  The
aggregation is done by a function <tt>total_count, total_size, node,
node_count, node_size: total_count + node_count, total_size +
node_size</tt> The first two argument, <tt>total_count, total_size</tt>
represent the count and size accumulated so far. The remaining
arguments, <tt>node, node_count, node_size</tt> represent input
from one of the nodes. The function computes an updated accumulator.

<p>Another common approach to combining results from nodes is to sort.
  For example, if two files have the same MD5 hash, then it is very
  likely that those files have the same content. To find all potential
  duplicates we can retrieve all rows and sort by MD5; the duplicates
  are then next to each other in the output:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql 'select path, hash from file' ] ^ \
          sort 'node, path, hash: hash' $
</pre>

<p>The <tt>sort</tt> command stores all input from all nodes and sorts
  by hash. (The argument to <tt>sort</tt> is a function that takes a
  tuple of input from a node and selects the hash.)

<p>The problem with this approach is that it requires the entire data
  set, from all nodes to be accumulated and sorted. This could consume
  a lot of memory, and could easily result in the Python process
  swapping, hurting performance.

<p>A better approach is to have each node sort its own data (in parallel), and then
  merge. This can be done in osh as follows:

<pre>
    <font color='grey'>zack$</font> osh @fred [ sql 'select path, hash from file order by hash' // 'path, hash: hash' ] $
</pre>

<p>Notice that the sql statement has been modified by adding <tt>order by
  hash</tt>. <tt>//</tt> indicates that the results from the nodes are
  to be merged. The function following the merge operator, <tt>path,
  hash: hash</tt> indicates that the merge operator expects inputs to
  be ordered by hash. The merge will combine the sorted inputs into a
  single sequence ordered by <tt>hash</tt>.
