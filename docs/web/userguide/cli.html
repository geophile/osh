<h1>Osh's Command-Line Interface</h1>

The osh executable interprets its command-line arguments as osh
syntax. Osh should be usable from any shell, although some osh CLI
syntax may require escapes in some shells. (The osh CLI has been
tested most extensively using the bash shell on Linux and OS X.)

<h2>CLI Usage</h2>

This osh command prints the integers 0 through 9 and prints the square of each:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh gen 10 ^ f 'x: x**2' ^ out
</pre>

Comments:
<ul>
  
<li>The first token on the command-line, <tt>osh</tt>, invokes the osh executable.
There are seven arguments to the osh command (<tt>gen</tt>, <tt>10</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, <tt>f</tt>, <tt>'x: x**2'</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, <tt>out</tt>). These arguments are tokens in a language parsed by
osh, and so the spaces present are significant. If any of the spaces between any adjacent tokens
were eliminated, the result would be a syntactically incorrect osh command.

<li>The space within
the 5th token, <tt>'x: x**2'</tt> is less important. This is Python code (a lambda expression, although the
<tt>lambda</tt> keyword is optional), so Python rules apply. 

<li><tt>gen 10</tt> is an osh command generating a stream of Python objects: <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>,
..., <tt>9</tt>.

<li><tt>^</tt> is the osh symbol that connects output from one command to input of the next, similar to
a Unix pipe. The first occurrence of <tt>^</tt> passes the integers generated by <tt>gen 10</tt>
to the next command, which squares them.

<li><tt>f 'x: x**2'</tt> takes a stream of integers as input, squares each, and writes the result
to the output stream. I.e., <tt>f</tt> is an osh command that applies a function to its input,
similar to the Python function <tt>map</tt>. 

<li><tt>^ out</tt> pipes the output from the <tt>f</tt> command (the squared integers) to the
  <tt>out</tt> command, which prints its input to stdout.

</ul>

<p>
As a syntactic convenience, the token <tt>$</tt> can be used instead of <tt>^ out</tt> at the
end of an osh command sequence. However, if this is done, then only default behavior for
<tt>out</tt> is obtained. (The <tt>out</tt> command has options for formatting, and for writing
to files.)

<p>
Input can be passed to an osh command sequence using a Unix pipe as follows:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> cat /usr/share/dict/words | osh ^ select 'w: len(w) >= 20' $
</pre>

This command begins by writing the contents of <tt>/usr/share/dict/words</tt> to stdout.
A Unix pipe is used to send this stream of data to osh. "<tt>osh ^</tt>" is a special syntactic
form which converts each line of input from stdin into a Python string (omitting the
line terminator <tt>\n</tt>).
These strings are passed
to the next command which keeps only those strings whose length is at least 20, and prints them to stdout.

<h2>Error and Exception Handling</h2>

The default exception and error handlers can be overridden by
invoking <tt>set_exception_handler</tt>
and <tt>set_error_handler</tt>f from <tt>.oshrc</tt>. (See the
documentation on the module <tt>osh.error</tt> for details.)


<h2>Running Arbitrary Python Code</h2>

There are two mechanisms for running Python code from the osh command-line interface.
One technique is to define variables, functions, etc. in <tt>.oshrc</tt> and then refer
to those symbols in osh commands, (see <a href="config.html">Configuring osh</a> for details).
<p>
The other approach is to use the osh commands <tt>imp</tt> and <tt>py</tt>. <tt>imp</tt>
imports modules for use by commands later in the command sequence. <tt>py</tt> runs arbitrary
Python code; the intent is to define symbols that can be used by commands later in the command
sequence. Both commands pass objects received on the input stream to the output stream. In both cases,
the import or python code is executed once, before objects start flowing on the streams
connecting commands in the command sequence. For example, the following command line
prints the area of circles with radii 0, 1, 2, ... 9:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh py 'pi = 3.14159265358979' ^ gen 10 ^ f 'r: (r, pi * r**2)' $
    (0, 0.0)
    (1, 3.14159265359)
    (2, 12.5663706144)
    (3, 28.2743338823)
    (4, 50.2654824574)
    (5, 78.5398163397)
    (6, 113.097335529)
    (7, 153.938040026)
    (8, 201.06192983)
    (9, 254.469004941)
</pre>

<h2>Parallel and Remote Execution</h2>

A special syntactic form is used for creating threads of execution. Example:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @3 [ sh 'sleep 5; date' ] $
    (0, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    (1, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    (2, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
</pre>

<tt>@3</tt> introduces three threads of execution. Each thread has state identifying the
thread, in this case the integers 0, 1, and 2.
The bracketed command sequence, <tt>sh 'sleep 5; date'</tt>, is executed on each thread.
<tt>sh</tt> is an escape to a native shell, so <tt>sh 'sleep 5; date'</tt>
is executed on each thread.
Each line of output contains the thread state, identifying the thread, and output from the executed
command.

<p>Thread state can also be generated by evaluating a function returning a sequence, e.g.
<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @'range(3)' [ sh 'sleep 5; date' ] $
    (0, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    (1, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    (2, 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
</pre>

The fact that all printed dates are the same shows that <tt>sleep 5</tt> executed simultaneously
on all threads.

The function is specified by <tt>'range(3)'</tt>. This is a function with no arguments generating
the integers 0, 1, 2.

<p>Finally, parallel execution can also be initiated by naming a cluster, e.g.
<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred [ sh 'sleep 5; date' ] $
    ('101', 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    ('102', 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
    ('103', 'Mon Aug  6 23:03:26 EDT 2007')
</pre>

In this case, thread state contains an object
describing a node in the named cluster, (configured in <tt>.oshrc</tt>),
and each thread runs the bracketed command on the indicated node.

<p>A subset of the nodes in a cluster can be specified as follows:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred:102 [ sh 'sleep 5; date' ] $
    ('102', 'Mon Aug  6 23:13:19 EDT 2007')
</pre>

<tt>@fred:102</tt> specifies that the command should be run on nodes of <tt>fred</tt>
whose name contains <tt>102</tt> as a substring. Since the names of the nodes in cluster
<tt>fred</tt> are <tt>101, 102, 103</tt>, only node <tt>102</tt> is selected.

<p><tt>@fred:10</tt> would select all nodes of the cluster since all node names contain
<tt>10</tt>.

<h2>Merging partial results</h2>

If multiple threads of execution produce ordered results, then the results can be merged.
For example, this command generates the numbers 0, 1 and 2 on each of three threads:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @"('a', 'b', 'c')" [ gen 3 ] $
    ('a', 0)
    ('a', 1)
    ('a', 2)
    ('b', 0)
    ('b', 1)
    ('b', 2)
    ('c', 0)
    ('c', 1)
    ('c', 2)
</pre>

The sequence produced by each thread is ordered. To produce a merged sequence, we provide a
merge function:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @"('a', 'b', 'c')" [ gen 3 // 'x: x' ] $
    ('a', 0)
    ('b', 0)
    ('c', 0)
    ('a', 1)
    ('b', 1)
    ('c', 1)
    ('a', 2)
    ('b', 2)
    ('c', 2)
</pre>

<tt>//</tt> is the <i>merge</i> operator, indicating that the
sequences produced by each thread are to be merged.  Each node's input
to the merge operator is a sequence of integers, (output
from <tt>gen</tt>).  The function following the merge operator, <tt>x:
x</tt> assumes that the inputs are ordered, (raising an exception if this assumption
does not hold); and interleaves tuples from the threads
so that the output sequence is ordered by the values from <tt>gen</tt>.

<p>If the merge function is <tt>x: x</tt>, then the function can be omitted, e.g.

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @"('a', 'b', 'c')" [ gen 3 // ] $
    ('a', 0)
    ('b', 0)
    ('c', 0)
    ('a', 1)
    ('b', 1)
    ('c', 1)
    ('a', 2)
    ('b', 2)
    ('c', 2)
</pre>
