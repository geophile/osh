<h1>Osh Installation</h1>

To use osh locally, follow the instructions for <a href="installation.html#local">Local Installation</a>.
Once osh is installed locally, you can install to all nodes of a cluster by following the
instructions for <a href="installation.html#cluster">Installation to a Cluster</a>.

<a name="local"/><h2>Local Installation</h2>

In order to run osh, you need:

<ul>
  <li>A Linux or OS X machine running at
least Python 2.3.  (Other operating systems and earlier versions of
Python may work.)
  <li>The osh distribution, <tt>osh-1.0.3.tar.gz</tt>, which can be obtained
    <a href="http://geophile.com/osh/osh-1.0.3.tar.gz">here</a>.
</ul>

Follow these steps to install osh:

<ul>
  <li>Create an installation directory and cd into it.
  <li>In the installation directory, unpack the osh distribution: <tt>tar xzvf osh-1.0.3.tar.gz</tt>
  <li>You should now have a directory named <tt>osh-1.0.3</tt>. cd into it.
  <li>Run this command: <tt>sudo python ./setup.py install</tt>
</ul>

Once installation is complete, you can delete the installation directory you created
and everything in it.

<p>Test that installation succeeded by running a simple osh command, e.g.

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$ </font>osh gen 3 $
    0
    1
    2
</pre>

<a name="cluster"/><h2>Installation to a Cluster</h2>

Before you can use the remote execution capabilities of osh, you must ensure that osh
is installed on the target cluster.

<p><b>Configure cluster in <tt>.oshrc</tt></b>:

Suppose that you want to configure a cluster named <tt>fred</tt> containing these nodes:

<pre>
    192.168.100.101
    192.168.100.102
    192.168.100.103
</pre>

osh configuration is specified in <tt>~/.oshrc</tt>. Create this file if necessary and make
sure it contains these lines:

<pre>
from osh.config import *

osh.remote.fred.user = 'root'
osh.remote.fred.hosts = {
    '101': '192.168.100.101',
    '102': '192.168.100.102',
    '103': '192.168.100.103',
    }
</pre>

This says that <tt>fred</tt> will be accessed as root (via ssh), and specifies
the IP addresses of the cluster's nodes. (See <a href="config.html">Configuring osh</a>
for more details.)

<p><b>Check connectivity over ssh:</b>

Access to a cluster is done over ssh. You must configure an ssh agent so that access via <tt>root</tt>
does not prompt for a password or generate any diagnostic messages. For example, to check
connectivity to cluster <tt>fred</tt>:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred [ testssh ] $
    '101' stderr: Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    '101' stdout: hello
    '102' stderr: Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    '102' stdout: hello
    '103' stderr: Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    '103' stdout: hello
</pre>

Each node of cluster <tt>fred</tt> was tested, and because it was the first ssh session
to each node, a warning was printed on <tt>stderr</tt>. The test command used by <tt>testssh</tt>
is <tt>echo hello</tt>, and that output is reported also.

The next run of <tt>testssh</tt> does not have any output on <tt>stderr</tt> because
the nodes are now registered in <tt>~/.ssh/known_hosts</tt>:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred [ testssh ] $
    '101' stdout: hello
    '102' stdout: hello
    '103' stdout: hello
</pre>

osh is now ready to install to the cluster.

<p><b>Install to cluster:</b>

To install osh on cluster <tt>fred</tt> run this command:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred [ installosh ]
</pre>

This must be run from a shell capable of running curses, (e.g. not an Emacs shell).
You will see a table showing installation progress for each node. 

<p><b>Check success</b>:

Once installation is complete, you can run remote osh commands. For example, this command
will report the osh version on each node:

<pre>
    <font color="grey">zack$</font> osh @fred [ version ] $
    ('101', '1.0.3')
    ('102', '1.0.3')
    ('103', '1.0.3')
</pre>
