<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSH_(shell)">PowerShell (formerly MSH)</a>

<br>PowerShell and osh are based on very similar ideas. Both pass objects
from one command to another. These objects represent various OS
concepts (process, file, etc.) or useful language constructs (number,
string, list, map, etc.).  Both stress the use of operations on
objects as replacements for text processing tools, such as grep and
awk, which are often used to extract object attributes from textual
representations of objects.  One major difference is that osh is
designed to be used from within an existing shell, such as bash; while
PowerShell, due to the absence of well-developed shells in the Windows world,
is a complete shell. Similarly, osh builds on a well-established
language, Python; while PowerShell includes a new language. (I'm unclear on
the relationship between PowerShell and other Microsoft languages.)


<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh">Cluster ssh</a> 
<br>Cluster ssh (cssh) allows you to interact with multiple nodes simultaneously. A console is opened
on each node. Whatever you type is echoed on all nodes. Very nice for
working with up to about eight nodes (IMHO). Beyond that the consoles
overlap or you need really tiny fonts. Also, no integration of results
across nodes.

<p><a href="http://www.theether.org/pssh">pssh</a> 
<br>Parallel versions of ssh, scp, rsync, nuke and slurp. Written in Python.

<p><a href="http://pussh.sourceforge.net">PuSSH</a> 
<br>PuSSH = Pythonic Ubiquitous SSH. A parallel version of
ssh with options for controlling degree of parallelism, timeouts, and 
node selections.

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycrust">PyCrust</a> 
<br>A graphical Python shell. Haven't tried it.

<p><a href="http://ipython.scipy.org">IPython</a> 
<br>IPython = Interactive Python, an alternative to the standard Python
shell. Haven't tried it.
