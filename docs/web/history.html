<tr>
    <td>1.0.3</td>
    <td>January 27, 2013</td>
    <td><ul>
        <li>Terminal output symbol ($) now formats output using %s. This avoids tuple notation for output tuples of size 1.
    </ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1.0.2</td>
    <td>October 3, 2010</td>
    <td><ul>
        <li>File and Process objects can now be transmitted, e.g. this works: <tt>osh @fred [ ls /foo/bar ] $</tt>
        <li><tt>ps</tt> command can now optionally omit the osh process itself from the list
          of processes.
        <li><tt>timer</tt> can now output time as a tuple or seconds since 1/1/1970.
        <li><tt>process.command_line</tt> renamed to <tt>commandline</tt>.
        <li><tt>sql</tt> command is now better at figuring out whether to report rows or a row count.
        Native postgres driver support has been disabled as a result. use a DBAPI driver instead.
        <li>Fixed bugs in handling of list- and tuple-valued accumulators for the <tt>agg</tt> and
        <tt>red</tt> commands.
        <li>Fixed long-standing bug in <tt>out</tt> command which occasionally resulted in misplaced
          newline characters downstream from a <tt>fork</tt> command.
    </ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1.0.1</td>
    <td>May 11, 2010</td>
    <td><ul>
        <li>MySQL now supported. (It just worked, but now I know.)
        <li>Added support for ssh identity files.
        <li>New command: <tt><b>red</b></tt> (reduce): A simplified form of the <tt>agg</tt> (aggregation) command.
          <tt>agg</tt> is more general. <tt>red</tt> is simpler, but should suffice in nearly all cases.
        <li>Replaced used of process module by subprocess.
        <li>Bug fixes.
    </ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1.0.0</td>
    <td>October 27, 2008</td>
    <td>Major overhaul:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Overhauled user guide:</b> Added page discussing osh concepts.
        <li><b>DBAPI 2.0 support:</b> Earlier versions of osh could only access Postgres databases, and
          only using the <a href="http://www.pygresql.org/">pygresql</a> driver.
          Osh now supports any <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">DBAPI 2.0</a>-compliant
          driver.
        <li><b>New commands:</b> <tt>ls</tt> (list files) and <tt>ps</tt> (list processes).
        <li><b>File support:</b> A <tt><b>File</b></tt> class has been added to osh, simplifying operations
          on files and directories. For example, <tt><b>osh ls /foo/bar ^ f 'file: (file, file.size)' $</b></tt>
          prints a list of file names and sizes for files in /foo/bar.
        <li><b>Remote execution and multithreaded execution:</b> Remote execution, (as in
          <tt>osh @cluster [ ... ]</tt>), created a thread for each node and then executed
          the bracketed command on each node. Forking and remote execution have been unbundled.
          The CLI syntax has been generalized to enable forking separately from remote execution.
        <li><b>Merging of ordered sequences:</b> If each thread of a forked command creates an ordered sequence,
          then it is often useful to merge the sequences into a single sequence. In earlier releases of osh,
          this would have required a sort. In many situations, the sort can be replaced by a merge.
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Bug fixes.
        <li>Added support for "running totals" to the <tt>agg</tt> command, (the <tt>-r</tt> flag).

    <td>0.9.0</td>
    <td>August 25, 2007</td>
    <td>
      Major overhaul of osh.
        <ul>
            <li>Removed the concept of named streams. They were only used to have separate output and error streams,
                and error streams were awkward to use, different in the CLI and API, and a mess internally. The 'o'
                stream is still present, but not named. It's just the one stream that carries objects from one
                command to the next. Exceptions and stderr output are handled by functions, which can be replaced
                by the user. Default implementations print to stderr.
            <li>Cleanup of module names, following introduction of package structure in version 0.8.0.
                E.g., osh.oshapi has been renamed osh.api.
            <li>Complete rewrite of documentation. Command-line help and reference manual
                are both derived from module and function __doc__ strings. The reference manual is
                generated using <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">epydoc</a>.
        </ul>
        Other changes:
        <ul>
            <li>gen command has new flag, -p, to format generated integers as 0-padded strings.
        </ul>
    </td>

<tr>
    <td>0.8.1</td>
    <td>April 15, 2007</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
            <li>Added cat command.
            <li>Improvements in error handling, especially remote errors.
        </ul>
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0.8.0</td>
    <td>January 8, 2007</td>
    <td>
<ul>
<li>Restructured so that top-level modules are in the <tt>osh</tt> package.
<li>Osh configuration file now supports slice notation, (e.g. <tt>osh.remote['cluster-123'].user = 'root'</tt>).
<li>Added version command.
<li>Added imp command.
<li>Added py command.
<li>oshapi errors are now reported as exceptions, not output on e stream. 
Better fit for a python script. This also enables osh() to return o stream output in a list.
<li>New oshapi command, return_list() to return o stream output in a list. Most uses of oshapi
no longer need to handle o and e stream outputs via handlers.
<li>Improvements in error handling, especially remote errors.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>oshtestssh is now much faster. It checks all nodes in parallel. 
<li>Fixed bugs and error reporting in the sql command.
<li>Cluster configuration can now specify a default database for each node of the cluster, (see documentation for sql command).
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0.7.0</td>
    <td>April 26, 2006</td>
    <td>Major upgrade:
<ul>
<li>Added an API: osh can now be used from within Python.
<li>Nodes of cluster can be configured as a list of addresses as before; or as a map in which the key is a logical
name and the value is the address.
<li>Generalized expand command.
<li>Modified options of window command.

propagate errors downstream.
Added <tt>-t</tt> option to <tt>out</tt>.
Much improved ctrl-c handling.

    <td>0.6.1</td>

Bugfix release. <tt>sql</tt> command no longer hides error messages from database system.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0.6.0</td>
    <td>October 31, 2005</td>
    <td>
Cleaner integration with Python functions. Previously, functions in <tt>f</tt>, <tt>select</tt>, etc. 
received a single argument, typically a tuple or list, and elements were obtained
by subscripting.
Now, the elements of
an incoming tuple or list are assigned to arguments. (If you want
to use a tuple argument, then prefix the argument declaration with '*', just
as in ordinary Python.) Also deleted spread command, replacing it with expand, which
is more general.

    <td>0.5</td>

processes function.

Lots of polishing and bug-fixing based on day-to-day usage in helping to develop

<tr>
    <td>0.3</td>

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0.2</td>
    <td>December 2004</td>
    <td>
Complete rewrite. Introduced piping of objects internal to python process, denoted by '^'. 
Everything after "osh" on the command line is concatenated into a single string
which is then parsed. Introduced tpg parser to parse command line.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>0.1</td>
    <td>October 2004</td>
    <td>
Each osh command ran as a separate process. Pickling was used to transmit objects between commands.
